a# BadBad-Bro

Welcome to **BadBad-Bro** - the app that takes your already questionable ideas and turns them into absolute disasters! Powered by AI with a superiority complex, this app is here to judge you, mock you, and maybe, just maybe, help you out a bit.

## Features

- üé§ **Voice Input**: Speak your mind (or whatever's left of it) and let the app transcribe your verbal masterpieces.
- ü§ñ **AI Chat**: Our AI will take your ramblings and try to make sense of them. Spoiler: it won't.
- üó£Ô∏è **Text-to-Speech**: Hear your AI-generated responses in a voice that sounds way too confident for its own good.
- üåä **Siriwave Visualization**: Watch the mesmerizing waveforms as the app processes your nonsense.

## How It Works

1. **Start the Mic**: Click the big red button to start the microphone. The app will start listening to your brilliant ideas.
2. **Transcription**: Your speech is sent to Deepgram for transcription. If it doesn't understand you, it's probably your fault.
3. **AI Processing**: The transcribed text is sent to our AI chat API. The AI will try to respond, but don't expect much.
4. **Text-to-Speech**: The AI's response is converted to speech and played back to you. Prepare to be underwhelmed.

## Usage
